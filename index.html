            The word ‘Adventure’ in itself is a relative concept. What might seem
          extremely adventurous to my timid self may be routine for someone
          else. The definition varies from person to person. Overall, it may be
          termed as a risky enterprise, a challenge that pushes us beyond our
          comfort zone and lands us into an uncertain zone. Fundamentally a
          sportsperson loves adventurous sport but other people also go for
          them.

           It is thrilling, it is exciting and it is daring. It is a repertoire
          of activities which add a new dimension to our lives and jolt us out
          of our complacence to potentially dare something which gives us a
          major adrenalin rush. For some, it must be a once in a blue moon break
          from monotony of life, for others it may be the way of itself.
